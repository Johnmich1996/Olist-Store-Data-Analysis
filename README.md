# Olist Store Data Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of the Olist e-commerce public dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding key business metrics, customer behavior, and operational efficiency to provide actionable insights. This project showcases the complete data analysis lifecycle, from data manipulation to creating interactive dashboards.

## Tools Used

* **Excel:** Data was cleaned and transformed using **Power Query** to prepare it for analysis.
* **MySQL:** SQL queries were used to join multiple datasets and aggregate data for key insights.
* **Power BI:** Data was cleaned and modeled using **Power Query** to establish connections between datasets, followed by the creation of interactive dashboards.
* **Tableau:** Multiple datasets were joined to create visualizations and build a comprehensive dashboard.

## Project Objectives

* Understand customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
* Evaluate overall business performance (e.g., sales, profit).
* Identify opportunities for performance improvement in logistics and customer satisfaction.

## Key Findings

Based on our analysis, we focused on the following key performance indicators:

1.  **Weekday vs. Weekend Payment Statistics:** Analyzing customer payment behavior throughout the week.
2.  **Number of Orders with a 5-Star Review and Credit Card Payment:** Understanding satisfaction and payment preferences.
3.  **Average Number of Days for Pet Shop Delivery:** Evaluating the logistics efficiency for a specific product category.
4.  **Average Price and Payment Values from Customers in Sao Paulo:** Highlighting the purchasing power of a specific geographic area.
5.  **Relationship Between Shipping Days and Review Scores:** Connecting delivery speed to customer satisfaction.

## Recommendations for Improvement

Based on our analysis, we identified several opportunities to enhance Olist's performance:

* **Improve Logistics and Delivery Times:** Our findings show a clear link between faster delivery and higher customer satisfaction. Olist can improve its delivery performance by optimizing shipping routes, considering new delivery partners, and improving inventory management.
* **Enhance Customer Satisfaction:** Since positive reviews are tied to a good customer experience, Olist can invest in proactive customer service and follow-up communication to maintain and improve review scores.
* **Targeted Marketing:** The data highlights specific customer behaviors and purchasing patterns. This information can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns for different customer segments and regions, potentially increasing sales and revenue.

## Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the project, we faced a few key challenges:

* **Handling Large Datasets:** The initial datasets were large and unstructured, making them difficult to work with. We overcame this by using **Power Query** in Excel and Power BI to clean and prepare the data.
* **Connecting Multiple Datasets:** The data was spread across multiple CSV files without a clear relationship. We addressed this by using **Joins in MySQL and Tableau**, and **data modeling in Power BI**, to connect the datasets and create a unified view for analysis.
* **Formulating Insights:** It was a challenge to turn raw data into meaningful business insights. We overcame this by taking an **iterative approach**, starting with simple observations and progressively refining our analysis to uncover deeper trends and patterns.
